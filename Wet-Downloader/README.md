# Wet Downloader

### **📌 How It Works**
1️⃣ **Reads `wet.paths`** → Extracts WET file paths to download  
2️⃣ **Downloads files** from **Common Crawl**  
3️⃣ **Tracks total downloaded size** and **stops at 750GB**  
4️⃣ **Displays real-time counter** every **10 seconds**  
5️⃣ **Skips already downloaded files** so you don’t redownload  

---

### **🚀 Next Steps**
🔥 **Run the script** and watch it **auto-stop at 750GB**  
🔥 Once files are downloaded, we **feed them into the dataset categorization pipeline**
