# Wet Unzipper

✅ **Scans all subdirectories** inside `wet_files/` to find `.gz` files  
✅ **Prints how many files it finds** before extracting (so we know it's detecting them)  
✅ **Handles errors properly** (e.g., if no `.gz` files exist, it tells you)  
✅ **Extracts into `unzipped_wet/` folder** for easy processing
